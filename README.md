The jupyter notebooks (a) `d+id_Fourier_filtering.ipynb` and (b) `d_wave_cuprate_Fourier_filtering.ipynb` contain codes to visualize the quasiparticle interference of the tunneling conductance before and after Fourier filtering, for (a) $d+id$ topological superconductor involving a phase winding and (b) $d_{x^2 - y^2}$ superconductor involving nodes in the gap function.

For details see https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16168.

The code utilizes the Julia programming language, and the IJulia package for Jupyter notebooks.
